![Design preview for the Metricks Frontend Assessment](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking this front-end assessment task.


## The task

Your task is to build out this multi-step form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can will be using React/Next and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as the component library to complete this task.

Your users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a public repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your assessment for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Create a custom `README.md`

* Add a README.md file explaining in details the specifications of your application. This should include among others:
  * The libraries and dependecies you used in implementing the application.
  * Step by step guide on how to run the application.
  * What you would like to improve in this application if it was not an assessment.(optional).

Remember, if you're looking for feedback on your task, be sure to ask questions when submitting it.

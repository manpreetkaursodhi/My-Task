## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

1. Component Design: Using React, the project demonstrated how to effectively organize UI components, making them reusable and maintainable. This approach helped in keeping the UI consistent throughout the application.
2. Utility-First Styling: Tailwind CSS enabled rapid UI development with its utility-first approach. It reduced the need to write custom CSS, thereby speeding up the development process and reducing style inconsistencies.
3. Responsive Design: Tailwind's responsive utilities were utilized to ensure that the application is mobile-friendly and looks good on all screen sizes, enhancing the user experience.
4. Efficiency in Development: Combining React's component logic with Tailwind's utility classes significantly streamlined the development process. This approach minimized the switching between CSS files and JavaScript logic, which improved productivity.
